# Around Rounda Bout
I decided to use this to at least learn something new since I have to spend time on it. Because of that I used few libraries that I need practice with or are completely new to me.

Pagination is set to `9` per page since it looks better

## To run the app
`yarn dev`

## Libraries
#### New / practice libraries
`vite`, `vite-plugin-ssr`, `@tanstack/react-query`

#### My favourite component library
`mantine`

#### Overkill for this, but why not...
`@reduxjs/toolkit`, `axios`, `html-react-parser`

#### In 6-12 months I would use
NextJs v13 when it gets out of beta, exited about that one.

#### Right now I would love to try
SolidJs - from the little I saw it looks amazing
